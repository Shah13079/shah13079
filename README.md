I'm Shah Hussain, software engineer. During the college I began finding out about web Scraping and all the more explicitly I've put the entirety of my enthusiasm on SCRAPY, this energy has developed on me and lead to work part time as a web scraper, so far I have worked on more than 100 projects, and the success I experienced motivated me to continue learning new things on a regular basis.
Now Working on contract-based projects as a free-lance Python developer, including web scraping, web automation, Django, and Rest APIS.

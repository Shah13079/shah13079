I'm Shah Hussain, a software engineer wih 5 years experiance in python. My interest in this field began during college, and I've since honed my skills with a focus on Scrapy. Over time, this passion has led me to work on over 200 projects, each contributing to my growth and experiance.

currently, I work as a freelance Python developer (top rated plus Upworker & level two on Fiverr) taking on contract-based projects. My areas of expertise include web scraping with scrapy, web automation through selenium, django, and django rest framework. Always love exploring new technologies.

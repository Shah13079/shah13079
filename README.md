I'm Shah Hussain, a software engineer with a passion for web scraping. My interest in this field began during college, and I've since honed my skills with a focus on Scrapy. Over time, this passion has led me to work on over 200 projects, each contributing to my growth and expertise.

Today, I work as a freelance Python developer, taking on contract-based projects. My areas of expertise include web scraping, web automation, Django, and REST APIs. I'm always eager to learn and explore new technologies to enhance my skills further.
